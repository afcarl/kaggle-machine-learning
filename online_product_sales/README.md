This is my submission script for the Kaggle Online Product Sales competition, found here: http://www.kaggle.com/c/online-sales. The goal was to predict the monthly sales of an unknown product, given sales training data. I built a separate random forest regressor for each of the 12 response periods, using python's sklearn library. I also used sklearn's DPGMM to build additional partition features for each training point. The code will score 0.61449 RMSLE.
